                    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-left my-5">Scope of - Var, Let, and Const</h1>
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-left my-2">Scope of var</h3>
                    <p class="text-base font-medium">
                        Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are
                        globally scoped or function/locally scoped.

                        The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any
                        variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole
                        window.

                        var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available
                        and can be accessed only within that function.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To understand further, look at the example below.
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        var greeter = "hey hi";<br>

                        function newFunction() {<br>
                        var hello = "hello";<br>
                        }<br><br>
                        Here, greeter is globally scoped because it exists outside a function while hello is
                        function<br>
                        scoped. So we cannot access the variable hello outside of a function. So if we do this:<br><br>

                        var tester = "hey hi";<br>

                        function newFunction() {<br>
                        var hello = "hello";<br>
                        }<br>
                        console.log(hello); // error: hello is not defined<br><br>
                        We'll get an error which is as a result of hello not being available outside the function.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-left my-2">Scope of Let</h3>
                    <p class="text-base font-medium">
                        A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within
                        curly<br>
                        braces is a block.

                        So a variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within that block. Let
                        me<br>
                        explain this with an example:
                        <br><br>
                        let greeting = "say Hi";<br>
                        let times = 4;<br>

                        if (times > 3) {<br>
                        let hello = "say Hello instead";<br>
                        console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"<br>
                        }
                        console.log(hello) // hello is not defined<br><br>
                        We see that using hello outside its block (the curly braces where it was defined) returns an<br>
                        error. This is because let variables are block scoped .<br>
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-left my-2">Scope of var</h3>
                    <p class="text-base font-medium">
                        Const
                        Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some <br>
                        similarities with let declarations.
                        const declarations are block scoped
                        Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were
                        declared.

                        const cannot be updated or re-declared
                        This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope.
                        It cannot be updated or re-declared. So if we declare a variable with const, we can neither
                        do<br>
                        this:
                        <br><br>
                        const greeting = "say Hi";
                        greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable.<br>
                        nor this:
                        <br><br>
                        const greeting = "say Hi";
                        const greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been
                        declared<br><br>
                        Every const declaration, therefore, must be initialized at the time of declaration.

                        There are several differences between null and undefined, which are sometimes understood as the
                        same.

                        Null: It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of

                        Undefined: It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.

                    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-left my-5">What is a REST API?</h1>
                    <p class="text-base font-medium">
                        An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or
                        devices can connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to
                        the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For
                        this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.
                        First defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation, REST
                        provides a relatively high level of flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is
                        just one reason why REST APIs have emerged as a common method for connecting components and
                        applications in a microservices architecture.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">REST design principles </span><br><br>
                        At the most basic level, an API is a mechanism that enables an application or service to access
                        a resource within another application or service. The application or service doing the accessing
                        is called the client, and the application or service containing the resource is called the
                        server.

                        Some APIs, such as SOAP or XML-RPC, impose a strict framework on developers. But REST APIs can
                        be developed using virtually any programming language and support a variety of data formats.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p class="text-base font-medium">
                        <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">How REST APIs work</span><br><br>

                        REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like creating,
                        reading, updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a
                        REST API would use a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT
                        request to update a record, and a DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in
                        API calls. A well-designed REST API is similar to a website running in a web browser with
                        built-in HTTP functionality.

                        The state of a resource at any particular instant, or timestamp, is known as the resource
                        representation. This information can be delivered to a client in virtually any format including
                        JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is popular
                        because it's readable by both humans and machines—and it is programming language-agnostic.

                        Request headers and parameters are also important in REST API calls because they include
                        important identifier information such as metadata, authorizations, uniform resource identifiers
                        (URIs), caching, cookies and more. Request headers and response headers, along with conventional
                        HTTP status codes, are used within well-designed REST APIs.
